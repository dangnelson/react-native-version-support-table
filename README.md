# React Native Version Support Table
A standardized table to be added to the beginning of React Native component README files which shows the version number and which version of React Native, iOS, & Android it was successfully last tested on by the developer.

## Example

| Version | React Native Support | Android Support | iOS Support |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | 0.34.1 | 7.1 | 10.0.2 |

*Complies with [react-native-version-support-table](https://github.com/dangnelson/react-native-version-support-table)*

## What this solves
Help solves the problem many developers face when starting new React Native projects with multiple components where build and or usage errors occur. Makes troubleshooting / choosing versions a more transparent process.

Saves component developers the headache of additional repository issues being created because new versions aren't yet supported.

## Usage

### Placement

Add after your first H1 title header. This allows for developers to see whether or not your component is compatiable with their app before diving into your documentation.

### Markdown
Copy this Markdown and add it to the beginning of your README file before the first header. Change the version numbers to the latest you've tested your component on.
```
| Version | React Native Support | Android Support | iOS Support |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | 0.34.1 | 7.1 | 10.0.2 |

*Complies with [react-native-version-support-table](https://github.com/dangnelson/react-native-version-support-table)*
```

### iOS / Android Only
Use "NONE" in place of version number.

Example:

| Version | React Native Support | Android Support | iOS Support |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | 0.34.1 | NONE | 10.0.2 |

### Multiple Versions
Add multiple rows (sort from newest to oldest) to show component versions successfully tested across additional Operating System or React Native versions. This should be used when there's a breaking change that doesn't allow the latest version of your component to support older verisons of React Native or Android / iOS. Links to seperate README files are recommended if documentation has changed between versions.

Example: 

| Version | React Native Support | Android Support | iOS Support | Documentation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.0 | 0.34.1 | 7.1 | 10.0.2 | [README]() |
| 0.9.2 | 0.33.0 | 7.1 | 10.0.2 | [README]() |

### Version Ranges

For a range of versions use a dash ( **-** ).

Don't use less than or equal to ( **<=** ) or greater than or equal to ( **>=** ) symbols as they suggests there's support for past/future versions the component may not actually work with.

Example: 

| Version | React Native Support | Android Support | iOS Support | Documentation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.8 | 0.28 - 0.32 | 7.0 - 7.1 | 10.0.0 - 10.0.2 | [README]() |
| 1.0.1 - 1.0.7 | 0.27 | 5.0 - 6.0.1 | 7.2 - 9.3.5 | [README]() |
